# Cyber Security Architecture Kata

Welcome to BPP's cyber security kata! We want you to create a small presentation and present it to the interviewing team.

## Overview
BPP are designing a new web platform and we want you to help us secure it.

## What we want from you
Based on the application design on the [PDF](https://github.com/BPP-Education-Group/bpp-technical-test/blob/main/cyber-security/Cyber-Security-Kata.pdf) in this repository, we want you to tell us how you would protect this system.  We want you to think about both the application and infrastructure security controls you would put in place.

This is what we are looking for:
* **Preventative controls** - how well can you block unauthorised access?
* **Detective controls** - how well can you identify unexpected activity or unwanted configuration?
* **Data protection** - how do you protect the data whilst it is in transit and being stored?
* **Incident response** - how quickly and effectively can you respond and recover from issues?

### A few important notes:
* Please keep this presentation less than 30 minutes long and do not spend more than 90 minutes working on it.
* You can use any presentation tool you wish. Google Slides, Powerpoint etc. 
* This architecture is design for Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* Please mention any specific tools / frameworks that you would use and why.
